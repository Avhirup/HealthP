            <p>Health, according to the World Health Organization, is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity".<br> Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep, and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress.<br> Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services.</p>

            <h1>Our Vision.</h1>
            <span>Our mission is to inspire people and motivate them to lead a Healthy life...</span>
            <p><br>Our first target is obesity. Obesity's health effects are deep and vast-and they have a
                real and lasting impact on communities, on nations, and
                most importantly, on individuals, today and across future
               generations.
               <br>
               <br>
               No less real are the social and emotional
               effects of obesity, including discrimination,
               lower wages, lower quality of life and a likely
               susceptibility to depression.
               <br>
               <br>
               To fight against obesity the most important thing that we need to do is we need to be disciplined and aware of our physical health.
               <br>
               <br>
               So we came up with the solution of trying to decrease the impact of
               obesity among people by making them aware of their physical health
               providing health charts and bmi calculator to calculate their weight
               according to their height also they can find out how much calorie a
               particular food item is so they can follow their diet properly.
               <br>
               <br>
               In future we will use the data of the users to give then customised diet chart and other health solutions based on their data.</p>
